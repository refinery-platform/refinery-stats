# refinery-stats
Altair code for Refinery Stats plots.


### Description
This repo contains the [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) scripts for generating visuals of Refinery usage. Altair (python library) is used to generate validated [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) schemas that can be embeded as HTML and reused. A working web example is located [here](https://beta.observablehq.com/@manzt/refinery-stats).
